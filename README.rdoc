= Openid MongoDB Store

OpenID requires some form of storage for its various cryptographic nuts and bolts. This project lets you use MongoDB (through the Mongo Ruby library) for that storage. This was pretty largely taken from the ActiveRecord adaptor.

== Install

gem install openid_mongodb_store

db = Mongo::Connection.new('localhost').db('testorama')
db.authenticate('foo','bar')
OpenidMongodbStore::Store.new(db)
